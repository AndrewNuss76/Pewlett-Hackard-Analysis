# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize SQL and data modeling techniques in Postgres to obtain information on retiring employees. Additionally, in this module the concept of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to undertand how primary and foreign keys can be leverage to bring together multiple disparate tables into new and combined tables to support analyses. For this analysis, we wanted to (1) Identify the number of titles of current employees who are retiring and (2) Identify if there are enough qualified retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation
